TOMBOLA GAME 
This project is a simple Python-based random number calling game inspired by Bingo or Housie, designed mainly for learning and entertainment purposes. In this game, each player is assigned 10 unique random numbers between 1 and 50, while the system generates another set of 10 random numbers that are called sequentially during gameplay. As each number is announced, the program automatically checks every player’s assigned numbers and marks the matched ones. If any player successfully marks all of their assigned numbers, that player is declared the winner. If no player matches all numbers after the calls are completed, the game ends without a winner.

The project is implemented using Python and relies on the built-in random module to generate non-repeating numbers. It demonstrates important programming concepts such as functions, loops, dictionaries, sets, condition checking, and user input handling. The program runs in a command-line interface, making it lightweight and easy to execute on any system with Python installed. Users only need to enter the number of players, and the rest of the process is handled automatically by the program.

This project is especially useful for beginners who want to understand how randomization, data structures, and game logic work together in Python. It can also serve as a foundation for further enhancements such as adding a graphical user interface, storing results in files, implementing score tracking, introducing multiple rounds, or even converting it into a web or mobile-based game. Overall, the project provides a fun way to practice Python programming while learning how to structure a complete mini-application.
